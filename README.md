The Synthchain – How It Works

Synthchain
The Synthchain refers to the collective synthetic Blockchain organized by Ether, Futereum notes, Zur Check Notes, MNY Notes and Coin Market Cap Coeval Notes. Together, these assets form a synthetic Blockchain, meaning that they undertake the roles and functions of different aspects of a Blockchain in virtual form. The reason that the assets do this is in order to produce value, in the same way that a collection of miners, computer hardware or software programs, nodes and so forth operate a digital ledger in order to produce utility.

Assets
FUTR & FUTX are best thought of as scramblers. In order for value to emerge, there must be some sort of principle exchange taking place so that comparisons of utility can be made. For instance, in order for oil to have value, it must first be exchanged with a dollar, or a bar of gold, or any other form of utility or utility-value that gives it a nominal unit of value. Futereum contracts achieve this same effect by swapping back and forth for Ether, thereby initiating the primary form of value-event on the synthchain.

MNY Notes are the resultant cash that emerges from these Futereum Notes when they are re-organized according to the pattern of the first 8 years of Bitcoin’s trading history.

COE Notes are Index Trackers, bumped up in value similar to a leveraged investment product (but without the use of debt) by MNY’s hyperinflationary characteristic. As a digital asset that is sold exclusively via MNY at point of retail, for an amount of MNY that correlates with the exact position of CoinMarketCap’s total capitalisation at the point of sale, COE benefits from increases in the value of the overall cryptocurrency market to a very precise extent while also benefitting from MNY’s inbult rapid price ascension (inherent in the sharp cost of production escalation that is manifest by tracing bitcoin’s initial 8-year price history).

ZUR Notes are miners or synthetic master nodes; in a similar way to how master nodes or mining software produces units of digital currency (very often based on the currency’s utility), ZUR synthetically mimics this process by acting as a value delivery system for COE that is mined via MNY at point of retail. Whenever COE is mined, the miner subsidises the ZUR holder by paying a 35% fee which is delivered to the ZUR holder by means of auctioning a function in the Zur Check smart contract.

Wrappers
Wrappers are tokens designed to wrap the digital notes in a tokenized smart contract. Digital notes do not function like ordinary tokens; because their smart contracts hold much greater amounts of value than the average token this makes them more like precious assets. As such, using them on exchanges or engaging them in any other form of uninsured third party custody activity is potentially value-deprecating. 

For example, if a ZUR Note is left on exchange, where the trader employs the use of a proxy to buy and sell, in the period during which the Zur Note is held on exchange, potential value manipulation could take place. 

The exchange could for instance mine a very large amount of COE which would feed the Zur Notes and drain off the COE, while simultaneously selling large amounts of the Zur Notes back into market. This is not the only example of potential abuse that could occur with digital notes at all, but it illustrates well the risk with trading with such value-enhanced assets.

In order to counter this type of risk, we developed wrappers. Wrappers are really simplified notes. They are freely exchanged for digital notes and then freely re-exchange for the same digital notes at any point in time. 

Wrappers do not of course solve the problem of digital note asset theft occurring while trading on exchanges, since the exchange could potentially swap the wrapper back for the underlying digital note and empty the content of the note’s smart contract by engaging it in a swap or in an instant mine, but in the event such an incident occurred, it would be very obvious very quickly what was happening, and responsiveness would thus be much more immediate. Wrappers are essentially shields: while not full-proof, they offer enhanced protection of underlying digital note assets.

One of the aspects of wrappers that is intriguing in their ability to reorganize supply. Because the supply of the Synthchain digital notes is so erratic, substantial risk is potentially encountered with respect to sever trading volatility affecting the various assets, especially as the supply sums vary by such wide margins. 

Zur for example has 35 trillion units; this is an order of magnitude 1 billion times that of COE, 35% of the 100,000 units per cycle of which are delivered to these much greater number of digital assets. With MNY issuing 21 million units per cycle there is next to no correlation between the assets, their functionality and/or interoperability, further increasing the potential for systemic failure of the Synthchain.  

In order to overcome this second problem with respect to Synthchain assets, we reorganized the wrappers according to supply correlations that more appropriately fit the individual unit’s cycles and value exchanges, starting with the observation that there would likely be a somewhat smaller than 8 year period for the synthetic MNY cycles, to approximately 5 years. 

We did this by taking COE as the center of synthetic equilibrium, given that MNY mines into COE and that COE delivers to ZUR. In order to efficiently calculate an appropriate value-utility ratio for ZUR we calculated an average growth company’s market value premium (16) and took into account the total supply of MNY by the total supply of COE (210), dividing the former into the latter to produce a sum which we rounded down by a fraction for ease of calculation (13). We took this sum and multiplied it by the current MNY supply to give a total wrapped MNY cycle of 273 million wrapped MNY.

Then, in order to arrive at the wrapper sum for ZUR, we calculated that with 0.0001 ZUR in issuance per every COE delivered per cycle to ZUR, that there would be 350,000,000 ZUR in issuance. 

To get the multiplier for COE, we considered that with 210 MNY per COE in issuance and with 0.82 COE cycles per annum, we had a total of 172 MNY / COE delivered to ZUR, around the same percentage of which would remain inter-cycle in terms of value-utility distribution, producing a multiplier of 144. This gave us 273 million MNY for every 14.4 million COE, implying one MNY cycle per every 4.9 years, which fit our estimates precisely.  Together these multipliers give a value-utility ratio that is much easier to comprehend. 

What is also exciting to consider though is that If we establish that COE retails currently then at $570, and that COE wrappers will thus be around $3.25 on exchanges ($50 million market cap), then this leads to the observation that ZUR wrappers will trade at equilibrium parity at $25 each, putting ZUR with 350,000,000 supply at a value of $8.75 billion. Even discounting substantially for early gains increases, this market capitalization falls safely within the Top 10 CoinMarketCap coins.

Even if the math is not obvious to you at first glance consider the following: we are taking Ether as a value and squeezing it via a series of synthetic exchanges via 1,600+ wallets, which we then reorganize in overall supply terms according to multiplies and premiums that represent the likely returns those assets will yield over the next 3-5 years. In this way, value has been represented accurately and sustainably on the Blockchain for the first time in history.
